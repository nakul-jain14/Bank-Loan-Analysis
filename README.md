# 📊 Bank Loan Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing a bank's loan data to extract valuable insights for decision-making. It includes a data pipeline developed using **SQL** for querying and **Excel** for dashboard visualization. The project demonstrates proficiency in data manipulation, analysis, and dashboard design.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform in-depth analysis on loan data using SQL and create interactive dashboards in Excel that provide a summary of loan metrics. This project is divided into two main dashboards:

1. **Summary Dashboard:** Offers an overview of key loan statistics such as total loan applications, funded amounts, and repayment metrics.
2. **Overview Dashboard:** Provides detailed visualizations on loan distribution by state, purpose, employee length, and more.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **SQL**: Used for data extraction and querying from the dataset.
- **Excel**: Utilized for data analysis and dashboard creation.
- **Excel Dashboards**: Two dashboards (Summary & Overview) with KPIs, slicers, and interactive visuals.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **SQL Queries:** Extracted relevant data from a bank loan database to calculate metrics such as total loan applications, funded amounts, and repayment details.
- **Dynamic Dashboards:** Created two fully dynamic dashboards in Excel with slicers to filter data by multiple dimensions (loan purpose, state, etc.).
- **KPIs:** Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as total loans issued, total funded amounts, average interest rate, and debt-to-income ratio.
- **Data Granularity:** Detailed breakdown of loan applications by various dimensions including employee length, loan purpose, and home ownership.

## 📊 Dashboards

### 1. **Summary Dashboard**

Provides a quick snapshot of loan metrics, including:
- Total Loan Applications
- Total Funded Amount
- Total Amount Received
- Average Interest Rate
- Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)

### 2. **Overview Dashboard**

Offers deeper insights by visualizing:
- Loan Applications by State
- Loan Applications by Purpose
- Loan Applications by Employee Length
- Loan Applications by Home Ownership

## 📂 Project Structure

- `SQLQuery1.sql`: Contains SQL queries used to extract and analyze the bank loan data.
- `bank_loan_analysis.xlsx`: Excel file with raw data, pivot tables, and dashboards.
- `summary_dashboard.png`: Image of the Summary dashboard.
- `overview_dashboard.png`: Image of the Overview dashboard.

## 📈 Data Insights

- Analyzed a total of **38,577 loan applications**.
- Created visualizations that break down loan applications by key variables such as state, loan term, and employee length.
- The analysis highlights trends in loan approvals and repayments across various categories.

## 📸 Demo

Interactive Excel dashboards allow users to filter data dynamically, providing deeper insights into loan metrics. Below are examples of both the **Summary** and **Overview** dashboards.
